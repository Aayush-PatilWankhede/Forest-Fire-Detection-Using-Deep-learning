# Forest-Fire-Detection-Using-Deep-learning
Forest Fire Detection Using Deep Learning (CNN) This project uses Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect forest fires from images. The system is trained on a dataset of fire and non-fire images to accurately identify potential fire outbreaks in real-time or static images.
